## Getting Started

The Zoom API provides the ability for developers to easily add Video, Voice and Screen Sharing to your application. Our API is a server side implementation designed around REST, it does not support cross-origin resource sharing or access via a client side web application.

The Zoom API helps manage the pre-meeting experience such as creating, editing and deleting resources like users, meetings and webinars. It also provides access to post-meeting information for tasks such as reporting and analytics. It does not provide access to the in-meeting experience such as current attendee list, who is current speaker or ability to mute participants; if you seek these features please have a look at our SDKs.
