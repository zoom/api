# Introduction

The Zoom API provides the ability for developers to easily add Video, Voice and Screen Sharing to your application. Our API is a server side implementation designed around REST, it does not support cross-origin resource sharing or access via a client side web application. 

The Zoom API helps manage the pre-meeting experience such as creating, editing and deleting resources like users, meetings and webinars. It also provides access to post-meeting information for tasks such as reporting and analytics. It does not provide access to the in-meeting experience such as current attendee list, who is current speaker or ability to mute participants; if you seek these features please have a look at our SDKs.

## Endpoint

`<%= config[:api_host] %>`

The Zoom API endpoint is pretty straight forward. We require that you send all requests via https, requests sent to http will receive a 302 HTTP response code. The base URL is api.zoom.us followed by the version number of the API, currently at version 2.

## Webhooks

Webhooks can be used as notifications to keep your systems in sync with actions inside Zoom. Find more information about webhooks on the [Developer Portal](https://developer.zoom.us/docs/webhooks/)
